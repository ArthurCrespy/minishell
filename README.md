## Description

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.
Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
